> The security setup of Procon can seem daunting, but we'll explain all of this with examples to get you going.

## Roles

We'll define three different roles used for security. You can imagine the **Administrator** as the owner of the *Instance*, a **Game Admin** as some one the **Administrator** trusts and a **Player** as an anonymous/unknown user on the server that nobody knows.

### Roles

| Actor | Description |
| ------:| :-----------|

| ![alt text]({{assets}}/images/features-security-stock-game-admin.jpg "Security - Game Admin Role")  | The Game Admin is a user that would be allowed to execute a subset of commands |
| ![alt text]({{assets}}/images/features-security-stock-player.jpg "Security - Player Role")     | A Player on a server controlled by Procon. Typically wouldn't be allowed to execute any commands. |
