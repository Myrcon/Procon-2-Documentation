## Groups

> An **Instance** of Procon can have any number of custom groups.

A **Group** is a collection of *Accounts* and *Permissions*. You first setup a **Group**, define the *Permissions* any accounts attached to the group are allowed to execute and then create and attach *Accounts*

### Guest

Any *Player* not attached to an account will be restricted by the *Permissions* of the **Guest** group.

The **Guest** group allows for *Players* not attached to any account to execute commands.

> The **Guest** group has no permissions by default.
