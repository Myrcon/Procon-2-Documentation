## Protocols

> Can we get support for game “XYZ”?

More than likely. Procon is built to support multiple protocols and I personally find implementing this to be the most rewarding aspect. We had, before a major rewrite, the codebase working in TF2 and Call of Duty: Blackops (The project is that old now..)

The intent will be to support all games. That's the fun bit for me.

It's possible for others to write protocol support for Procon which can be downloaded in a similar way to plugins.

We refer to it as protocol instead of game, as we could also support Teamspeak and other services that allow external connections & commands.

> Which games does Procon support?

Procon's roots are in Frostbite based games. During the beta we'll be sticking with what we know, but we may include support for other games as the need arises.

When installed, Procon does not support any protocols. They must be downloaded in packages.
