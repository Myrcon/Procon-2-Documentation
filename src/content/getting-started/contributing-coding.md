## Coding

We don't have a set style guide, but you should endeavour to match the style of the code in the project. 

Submit a pull request. Provided all tests pass I'll take a look at it and provide some feedback pretty quick.

If you edit or add some functionality remember to accompany it with a few unit tests!  If it's lacking those then it'll probably be my first bit of feedback.
