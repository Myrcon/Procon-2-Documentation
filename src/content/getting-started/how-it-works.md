> Procon is split into two logical, self contained programs. The **User Interface** (UI) and the **Instance**

The UI controls everything you see, while the instance connects to your game server(s), manages plugins etc.

The UI shows you things. The Instance does the things.

Myrcon can host your instance, or you can have it hosted at another gsp or even host it yourself!
