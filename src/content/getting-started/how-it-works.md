> Procon is split into two logical, self contained programs. The **Peeler** (User Interface) and the **Potato** (Server/Layer/Daemon)

The **Peeler** controls everything you see, while the **Potato** connects to your game server(s), manages plugins etc.

The **Peeler** shows you things. The **Potato** does the things.

Myrcon can host your **Potato**, or you can have it hosted at another gsp or even host it yourself!
