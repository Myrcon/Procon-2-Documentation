## Documentation

Anything! See a typo? Can better English? Put in a pull request!

All I ask is small individual pull requests for changes. Monster pull requests take a little bit of time to review.

The source for this documentation can be found at https://github.com/Myrcon/Procon-2-Documentation

### Compiling Documentation

You don't need compilation to contribute to the documentation, but it's nice to see your completed work. Compiling the documentation is easy, just work your way through the following steps.

Run the the commands in the root directory (where package.json and this readme is)

1. Install node/npm http://nodejs.org/

2. Install dependencies ```npm install```

3. Install grunt ```npm -g install grunt-cli```

4. Run grunt ```grunt```

5. Check your 'bin' folder for the completed documentation

- If your 'bin' folder is getting a little cluttered, run ```grunt clean```
