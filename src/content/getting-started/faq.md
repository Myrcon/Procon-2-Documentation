> The FAQ is a dumping ground for topics that may require expansion upon at a later date. Items may be moved out of here and placed into a section with examples at a later date.

- If you want to help documentation a little bit, feel free to append to the faq list. **However minor** it will help everyone working on the project to have a single source of knowledge.
- If you super want to help documentation, feel free to expand on a topic with details, formatting and move it to a proper section.
