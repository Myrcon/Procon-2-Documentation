## Naming

> The skinny of naming is: Official or introductory information should use the full name, while text within documentation/forums/etc. can use the shortened version.

### Procon

Landing pages, main pages or introductory text on all projects should refer to Procon as **"Procon 2"**.

Excluding landing pages or introductory text, Procon should be referred to as **Procon**. You may omit the version number.

Procon version 2.x is officially named **"Procon"**, but referred to as "Procon" or "Procon 2"

The rationale being that Procon will be the last remote console tool created by Myrcon, but maintained and updated. Procon Frostbite is heavily coupled with Frostbite based games and is unlikely to grow to support new protocols.

### Procon Frostbite

Procon version 1.x is officially named **"Procon Frostbite"**, but referred to as "Procon Frostbite", "Procon Fb", "Procon 1.x" or "Procon 1".

> Procon Frostbite was originally named *"PRoCon"*. Once I sobered up the capitalization was removed from as many sources as possible in late 2010 - early 2011.

### Myrcon

Myrcon is officially named **"Myrcon Pty. Ltd."**, but referred to as "Myrcon" or "Myrcon Pty. Ltd."

Copyright notices should use the full name **"Myrcon Pty. Ltd."**

All other locations should refer to the company as **"Myrcon"**

It's unknown how to pronounce the name, but feel free to argue about it!
