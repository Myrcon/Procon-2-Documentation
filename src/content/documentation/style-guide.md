> Wait! This guide is targeted towards those helping with the documentation.

Keep the documentation concise and include references to materials, never copy from the source.

Include small sections that work together, but the order does not matter. Each section should be self contained information.

Include diagrams but not screen shots. Screens shots of a Peeler age considerably faster than simple instructions pointing a user to complete their action.

> If the task is so complicated it requires a screen shot, then it's a fault of the UX not the documentation.

Include useful information or nothing at all. *"The map panel manages maps"* isn't a useful statement as users would be lead to the same conclusion.
