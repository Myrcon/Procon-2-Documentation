## Actions

Point users to complete actions with a breadcrumb approach.

> **UI** > **Dashboard** > **Connection** > **Player** > Check the checkbox next to the player

Prefix all breadcrumbs with **UI** or **Instance** so all actions have a clear target.

All breadcrumbs should be absolute paths so users may pickup at any point and find their way to their desired action.
